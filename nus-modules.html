        <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">These are the reviews of the classes I took as an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics in NUS. These reviews are mine alone. I will only update this page twice a semester, as I have no time to propely maintain this page. But rest assured, all my reviews are all legit.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing.
                                Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. Topics covered include functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module was taught in Source which is a sublanguage of Javascript built by the professors themselves.
                            I do not have any experience with Javascript so everything was new to me. I had programming experience prior to university and thus I had no issue in learning the overall syntax. In this module, 
                            learning how to think computationally matters more. </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There were missions and optional quests that were done on a game platform the professors built called Source Academy and there were 2 missions and maybe 2 optional quests released weekly which amounted to the huge workload.
                            I personally think this module is a bit overkill in the logistics. Tutorials were fun and I made many friends during the sessions. </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Assessment-wise, there was a lot of CAs. These include Reading Assessments(RA) (2 of them), a midterm, a practical exam and a final.
                            I struggled with RA1 as I was really nervous, but I did well for RA2 as I managed to keep my nerves in check. Midterm was atrocious (for me personally, others will disagree) as I panicked and could not think straight. Practical Exam was quite easy for me. I did panic which resulted me in skipping the first 5 parts of the 1st question which was supposed to be easy. Finals was ok, not hard.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Overall, I do not regret not dropping this module for CS2030S because I learnt to appreciate functional programming and communicate thought processes computationally by building mental models. It forms the basis of writing good code in the future. I would highly recommend all students who have to take CS1010 variants and a core to take this instead. I also encouraged others to take this module as an elective as well.
                            A fun module, but with an unnecessarily heavy workload.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module provides a basic foundation for calculus and its related subjects required by computing students. The objective is to train the students to be able to handle calculus techniques arising in their courses of specialization. In addition to the standard calculus material, the course also covers simple mathematical modeling techniques and numerical methods in connection with ordinary differential equations. Major topics Preliminaries on sets and number systems. Calculus of functions of one variable and applications. Sequences, series and power series. Functions of several variables. Extrema. First and second order differential equations. Basic numerical methods for ordinary differential equations.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module was taught by Prof Chan Heng Huat who is actually a number theory professor. All of us, including himself, were confused as to why he was assigned to teach this module. This prof, is a blessing. He is the most caring professor I have met and he always displays passion whenever he teaches. His lectures are twice a week from 6pm - 8pm.
                            There is a tendency for students to already be tired at that period but he really puts in the effort to get everyone engaged. He is very patient is taking questions even if they can be repetitive but he makes sure we understand the concepts well.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">As mentioned above, there were 2 lectures on Wednesday and Friday, both at 6pm - 8pm. Tutorial classes were all conducted by him. He refused to hire TAs as he was worried they are not good enough. What a beast.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There is a weekly graded quiz of 5 questions every week and 3 tests. All were manageable, especially for me with a H2 Further Math / H3 Math background. What I was frustrated about (with my cohort), is that there were a lot of cheating cases which was infuriating. It made me put in more effort than I had planned on this module to be ahead of the bell curve. I appreciate how the professor handled the situation though. After I heard about the cheating cases, it strengthed my resolve to destroy those cheaters in the tests no matter what.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I found this module to be of light workload and easy. I did the tutorials, quizzes and exams pretty fast and I also did quite well. I think people tend to struggle with tests of convergence for series and sequences, and double/triple integrals. Having learnt them before, it was a breeze for me.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is a first course in linear algebra. Fundamental concepts of linear algebra will be introduced and investigated in the context of the Euclidean spaces R^n. Proofs of results will be presented in the concrete setting. Students are expected to acquire computational facilities and geometric intuition with regard to vectors and matrices. Some applications will be presented. Major topics Systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, Euclidean spaces, linear combinations and linear span, subspaces, linear independence, bases and dimension, rank of a matrix, inner products, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, linear transformations between Euclidean spaces, applications.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module was taught by Prof Victor Tan and Dr Jonathan. Both are competant lecturers but I am at the slot in which Prof Victor teaches. He goes at a slow enough pace for beginners to grasp him. Patience is really key.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We are expected to watch lecture videos on Tuesdays and attend the lecture conducted via Zoom on Friday. The Zoom lectures are meant to supplement the Tuesday recorded lectures and we have the chance to do some thinking questions with the Prof. Tutorials are really meme. The TA would break us up into breakout rooms and discuss the problems. But problem is no one will talk. It will be radio silence until some hero (usually me) start to speak up. It is very annoying. But whatever, because I already learnt Linear Algebra in H2 F-Math, so I have nothing to lose. Tutorial questions are easy for me. We also had to do Matlab worksheets, which was quite new to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Assessment-wise, tutorial attendance (not participation lol) was graded, we have 5 HW and a Final exam. The 5 HW was easy for me, but I will cross-check answers with my friends in case got any computation carelessness.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Easy module for H2 Fmath students, I have no issue with the module. Even if it is taught by a trash professor, I think I will do well regardless. Finals was easy for me. Make sure to utilise MATLAB fully to save time on computation. It is open book as well, but I would highly advise against referring to material as it just shows you do not have a good grasp on the concepts. Do the textbook questions. JUST DO THEM!</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module was taught by Prof Aaron Tan and Prof Wong Tin Lok (from Math dept). Prof Aaron is very passionate and Prof Wong's notes are top-class and rigorous. If you ask me, I prefer Prof Wong teaching this entire module.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are 2 lectures, 1 x 2hr and 1 x 1hr and 1 x 2hr tutorial. Tutorial sheets are challenging which I enjoy solving a lot.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">We are graded by 2 HW Assignments, Tutorial Attendance, a midterm and a final. Note that the exams are notorious for being extremely challenging for those who hate mathematics.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is actually my favourite module for my first semester of university. This is because it was new content that I had never learnt before. The ideas were not hard to grasp, but the questions can be very unnecessarily complex. I have a bone to pick though towards the end of the module, specifically Trees and Graphs. These topics are the most important in my opinion, especially when studying Graph Algorithms. However, there was such little time, that it was being rushed through. Hence, there was not enough time to actually internalise, appreciate and grasp the concept. I struggled alot with the last 2 topics. I actually did reasonably well for the Midterms but messed up the Finals as the nerves took over and my mind went blank. I was actually pretty confident of acing the Finals but I guess the pressure got the better of me. I did not do so well hence. Expected an A, but got somewhere near. This failure will forever haunt me.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">More people live in cities now than in any other point in history: how does this change human culture and civilisations? Cities tell a story of our world; they are a testament to humankind’s ability to reshape the environment in lasting ways. They reveal how we interact with the environment and with each other. Cities are created in many forms and for many reasons ranging from defense, religion and economic activity. Through case studies this module examines urban history, lived experiences and how city life has changed over time.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module was taught Prof Reyes Portia. She is a very kind and patient Prof. As I was just a freshman navigating my way through University, I constantly emailed her whenever I had doubts. She was quick to reply and encouraging as well. I was once confused by the Chicago Style Citation as there were many variations so I emailed her for clarification. She is a very passionate professor as well and anyone would be lucky to have her teach them. This is my first GE mod under FASS and I do not regret this.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is 100% CA : CA1 is a 250 essay on an image, CA2 is something like an online commentary, CA3 and CA4 are joint final projects</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There is only one lecture every week and we just had to watch videos. Tutorials occur every fortnightly. My TA is Tomoko and she is very helpful. I had a lot of trouble with my essays as I am not really that good in writing but she readily gave me tips on how to improve. Hence, my CA grades improved tremendously. I got a B- for CA1, B+ for CA2 and finally A- for my final project. My tip for this module, hence, is to always seek feedback from your TA directly if you want to improve your CA grades. They are really helpful!</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is very chill for me. I have always enjoyed History as a kid and I enjoyed learning about the History of cities. It is very mindblowing when I learned some of the new ideas pertaining to cities. I used to struggle with essays, so when I got my first B- for my CA1, I was really crushed because I thought I had put in a lot of heart and effort but to no favourable results. However, I enjoyed writing CA2 and my final project because I started to learn how to form unique and critical arguments and this led to deeper discussions in my essays. I also tried to put myself in the perspective of the people living in the cities by watching a lot of documentaries and films online. This really made me "feel" the module, if you can relate.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is a follow up to CS1010. It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are 2 x 2hr lectures and 1 x 1hr Recitation and 1 x 2hr Labs each week</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are weekly labs, 2 Practical Exams, 1 Midterm and a Final. The labs are meant to make sure you have hands on experience in applying what you have learnt. The 2 Practical exams are notorious for being hard, however I somehow managed to get close to full marks for them. For PA1, I got 29/30 only because I was blind. The compiler threw a warning of raw types but for some reason I cannot find it. Took me 1hr after exam ended to finally locate it. I thought I messed up the finals but somehow performed at the upper quartile. Finals was easy for me.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I personally feel very stressed for this module. This is because I am very new to Java as I am used to writing only C++ code. The labs were also very tedious and I would spend quite a while to complete. Marks were deducted for the most trivial mistakes. It is insufficient to just learn from the notes, one needs to code often to really grasp the concepts. Experiment as much as possible and try to undertand why something does or does not work. It is very crucial to find out what you are unsure about and this will help you greatly, as it had helped me. I faced some health issues when doing this module too as I got struck with dengue on the day of PA2. I had to miss lessons but I made enough new friends to actually help me catch up. My TA also managed to accommodate me when I had to rush to the hospital for the blood test by setting up a Zoom Lab lesson. As for module content, this is the first time I came across functional object-oriented programming. Hence, everything was very interesting for me. I was particularly interested in Monads, Functors and also Asynchronous Programming. It prompted me to explore them a little bit deeper after exams and now I am planning to take CS3210 Parallel Computing. Despite all the challenges, I was heartened to get an A for this module.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is taught by Prof Seth Gilbert. Prof Seth tends to speed during the lecture, hence I was unable to understand, let alone internalise what he delivered. However, he is very passionate about algorithms.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are 2 x 2hr lectures and 1 x 1hr recitation and 1 x 2hr tutorial.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are 8 Problem Sets done on Coursemology with several optional PSets for the opportunity to gain for XPs, followed by a Midterm and a Final. The weightages are not disclosed.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I enjoyed this module very much despite the large workload. We were given a 1hr crash course on Java on our 2nd lecture which I do not really follow. For some reason. I personally learnt a lot for this module. It really deepens the way I think of using algorithms to solve problems. Sometimes, we just have to modify the problem and use the algorithm as a black box, otherwise, we can modify an aspect of the algorithm to solve a problem instance. Recitations were taught by Jin Zhe, who is very encouraging. I always make the effort to voice out any ideas fearlessly and even managed to solve a question brilliantly. Recitations will introduce more materials which are also examinable. It mainly contains topics that could not be squeezed into the main lecture series, like B-trees, Heaps and Graph Transformation. I struggled a bit by Dynamic Programming as it is the last topic and was taught pretty rushed. I did average for Midterms but very well for the Finals. I think most importantly, we must learn to be flexible and exploit the advantages of several data structures to solve the problem effeciently. This really motivated me to pursue the Algorithms and Theory track. I highly recommend reading CLRS for a better grasp for the topics.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module introduces students to basic probability theory and statistical inference. Topics include basic concepts of probability, conditional probability, independence, random variables, joint and marginal distributions, mean and variance, some common probability distributions, sampling distributions, estimation and hypothesis testing based on a normal population.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is taught by the Statistics Department, Prof Chan Yiu Man and Prof Yu Tao. I belonged to the lecture group of the latter.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are 2 x 2hr lecture slots, but one of the lecture slots was used to watch the lecture recording, the other was simply a zoom lecture to consolidate the content learnt. For Prof Yu Tao, we requested for pop quiz every lecture which he gladly obliged.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are 4 quizzes throughout the module totally 30% in total, then a final exam worth 70% (35 MCQ, or fill in the blanks, no partial marks, no backward navigation)</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is a breeze for me since most of the content was taught during H2 Mathematics and Further Mathematics. However, there were new topics like F-distribution, Joint Probability Distributions etc. However, they were not much of an issue. If you own a graphical calculator, getting the answer is a matter of pushing buttons on it. I was very annoyed by the format of the Finals. I had to convince myself an answer is correct before moving on. There is no chance for any regret or dumb mistakes. Tutorials were a piece of cake. I attend the online Tutorials but paid zero attention to the tutor.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module gives an introduction to Ethics in the Computing domain. Students will learn about the importance of Ethics in Computing policy-making and be able to make judgements and decisions based on established ethical frameworks (such as Deontology, Consequentialism, Social Contract Theory and Virtue Ethics). The objective is to develop students to be ethical computing decision-makers who can analyse and explain their decisions in real-world policy-making situations. Issues in emerging areas such as Digital Intellectual Property Rights, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Social Media, Hacking, and interface design may also be discussed in relation to Ethics.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The module is coordinated (not taught) by Dr Lu Weiquan. We were told to read the textbook, 1 chapter per week and answer 10 MCQ questions for 10 weeks. The questions were very subjective and me and my friends actually spent time debating on a lot of issues. Perhaps that was the intended purpose? I did learn something from the module. I might be one of the only few people that think this module is actually essential but not delivered effectively.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This is actually a very light workload module. The quiz questions could be CTRL-F-ed. Best to collaborate with your friends and save an SU for this module just in case your effort does not bear any fruit.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module aims to equip undergraduate students with essential data literacy skills to analyse data and make decisions under uncertainty. It covers the basic principles and practice for collecting data and extracting useful insights, illustrated in a variety of application domains. For example, when two issues are correlated (e.g., smoking and cancer), how can we tell whether the relationship is causal (e.g., smoking causes cancer)? How can we deal with categorical data? Numerical data? What about uncertainty and complex relationships? These and many other questions will be addressed using data software and computational tools, with real-world data sets.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is taught via sectional teaching. It occurs every 2 weeks</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Weekly quizzes are given and there are multiple attempts allowed. A lot of us scored full marks for this part of the assessment. We had to complete a midterm, project and final.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I really lost patience and hated this module with a passion. This module is too trivial for me so I totally did not care about this module. I was concurrently taking ST2334 and I felt that a lot of material taught in GEA1000 was repeated and not rigorous which lost my attention and appreciation for the module. Midterms went disastrous for me because of an invigilator who keeps distracting me by turning on her mic over zoom to call people out to turn on their camera every 2 minutes which led me to constantly lose my train of thoughts and redid the question. Hence I was really dissatisfied with my performance over the midterms. For the project, I pretty much carried most of the time because apparently I am the only one who knows what is going on. I even at the last minute, spotted a very glaring error and had to correct them on the spot. I pretty much gave up for the finals but it is not that hard as well. After the midterms, I was mentally prepared to SU this stupid module.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module introduces students to the forging of the Chinese Singaporean community by observing the changes in linguistic data over time. Drawing linguistic data from different aspects of society and entertainment (eg. food, movies, theatre and so on), the module aims to reveal to students how the Chinese community has evolved from being a community with multiple languages to a single, unified language. Influential professionals in their field of expertise will also share from their personal experience the evolution of the Chinese community, and how the Chinese Singaporean community fits into Singapore’s multiracial society.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There are 2 essays to be written, and a final.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There is a lecture and a tutorial which occurs fortnightly. I would say that the tutorials are not really that interesting and we had to prepare presentations on the spot (and they are graded)</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I think I learnt a lot from the module and it is actually quite chill. It deepened my understanding of my own heritage and connection to my ancestors in this region. It is indeed an eye-opening experience. The tutorials however, are a complete waste of my time. I also experienced what class participation wars are for the first time. I personally do not take part in these type of stunts because I believe one should just keep his own mouth shut instead of bs-ing something of no value.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module is my first forray into Software Engineering. My partner and I attempted Orbital at the Artemis level. Everything was new to me and I had to learn a lot of technologies from scratch. Previously, I only had research background and I normally play around with research problems. My partner and I built a mobile application which can help students do module planning more seamlessly by using a SAT Solver. Our TA was very encouraging and was always ready to lend a helping hand by giving us useful advice to point us in the right direction when we lack the necessary technical knowledge.
                                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
                                    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The entire frontend was built using XML and Android Java with Materials UI whereas the backend (Solver) was built entirely in Python. One particular problem I encountered was handling database calls. I realised, through monitoring the database calls, that reading and writing into the database was asynchronous. When I tried to write and read into the database in that sequence, I realised that the document was being modified whilst being read, which lead to a lot of incorrect output. I had no experience in Asynchronous Programming, but I learnt how to use the Completable Future Monad to handle such database calls. I even took up Parallel Programming courses so that I could better understand how multi-threading works and how to go about properly parallelising tasks.</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">My partner and I also had issues with the UI design of our Android App. The entire aesthetic look of the App was built using XML and Material UI. Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve the look that many other teams achieved (by using higher level API and other frameworks). Nonetheless, despite us building our app using Android Java, and also a lack of artistic flair on our part, we redid the entire look of our app. We also received praise by our mentor and 3 other teams during our project evaluation that our UI greatly improved by miles.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Another issue was setting up the backend for our app. We were using Heroku free tier to run our backend scripts as well, but due to the large number of build packs used, deploying was impossible as the server would time out after 15 minutes. Due to our inexperience, we tried to download and precompile 23GB of slug and then push them into the backend instead to save time. However, our computers were not configured to the environment required for the slug to compile and so we spent 3 days trying to figure out a workaround. However, it was easily resolved with an email to Heroku’s Helpdesk to extend the build time to 30 minutes instead after realising pre-compilation was an impossible task.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Lastly, compatibility issues were also a very huge problem from the start. We originally planned to use Google ORTools as one of the API to implement a feature of the app. However, it was not well documented that ORTools API was not compatible with computers of ARM Architecture. I tasked myself to actually try out the API but realised that the native libraries could not be loaded. I then spent 1 full week trying to debug the API but to no avail. We only found out after searching through Stack Overflow that the maintainer mentioned that it was not tested on M1 Macs yet. We had to abandon the API and used Z3 SMT Solver instead which was developed by Microsoft. This would make the implementation more complex as well, but regardless, we managed to build the feature successfully and adhere to Software Engineering Principles despite the added complexity.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Despite all these challenges, my partner and I managed to achieve the highest level of achievement possible for the module and even presented our posters during the project showcase. The achievement came with many setbacks along the way, but it definitely taught me to be resilient and to persevere no matter what. I think these traits are really important in the current workforce. We also learnt how to write industry-style code and several software engineering principles which would be very valuable to apply in any technology-based setting in the future. Thus, this challenging task actually turned out to be very fruitful and rewarding.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The objective of this course is to work on optimization problems which can be formulated as linear and network optimization problems. We formulate linear programming (LP) problems and solve them by the simplex method (algorithm). We also look at the geometrical aspect and develop the mathematical theory of the simplex method. We further study problems which may be formulated using graphs and networks. These optimization problems can be solved by using linear or integer programming approaches. However, due to its graphical structure, it is easier to handle these problems by using network algorithmic approaches. Applications of LP and network optimization will be demonstrated. This course should help the student in developing confidence in solving many similar problems in daily life that require much computing. Major topics: Introduction to LP: solving 2-variable LP via graphical methods. Geometry of LP: polyhedron, extreme points, existence of optimal solution at extreme point. Development of simplex method: basic solution, reduced costs and optimality condition, iterative steps in a simplex method, 2-phase method and Big-M method. Duality: dual LP, duality theory, dual simplex method. Sensitivity Analysis. Network optimization problems: minimal spanning tree problems, shortest path problems, maximal flow problems, minimum cost flow problems, salesman problems and postman problems.</p>
