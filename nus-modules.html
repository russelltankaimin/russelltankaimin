        <p style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">These are the reviews of the classes I took as an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics in NUS. These reviews are mine alone.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing.
                                Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. Topics covered include functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module was taught in Source which is a sublanguage of Javascript built by the professors themselves.
                            I do not have any experience with Javascript so everything was new to me. I had programming experience prior to university and thus I had no issue in learning the overall syntax. In this module, 
                            learning how to think computationally matters more. </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There were missions and optional quests that were done on a game platform the professors built called Source Academy and there were 2 missions and maybe 2 optional quests released weekly which amounted to the huge workload.
                            I personally think this module is a bit overkill in the logistics. Tutorials were fun and I made many friends during the sessions. </p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Assessment-wise, there was a lot of CAs. These include Reading Assessments(RA) (2 of them), a midterm, a practical exam and a final.
                            I struggled with RA1 as I was really nervous, but I did well for RA2 as I managed to keep my nerves in check. Midterm was atrocious (for me personally, others will disagree) as I panicked and could not think straight. Practical Exam was quite easy for me. I did panic which resulted me in skipping the first 5 parts of the 1st question which was supposed to be easy. Finals was ok, not hard.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Overall, I do not regret not dropping this module for CS2030S because I learnt to appreciate functional programming and communicate thought processes computationally by building mental models. It forms the basis of writing good code in the future. I would highly recommend all students who have to take CS1010 variants and a core to take this instead. I also encouraged others to take this module as an elective as well.
                            A fun module, but with an unnecessarily heavy workload.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module provides a basic foundation for calculus and its related subjects required by computing students. The objective is to train the students to be able to handle calculus techniques arising in their courses of specialization. In addition to the standard calculus material, the course also covers simple mathematical modeling techniques and numerical methods in connection with ordinary differential equations. Major topics Preliminaries on sets and number systems. Calculus of functions of one variable and applications. Sequences, series and power series. Functions of several variables. Extrema. First and second order differential equations. Basic numerical methods for ordinary differential equations.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">This module was taught by Prof Chan Heng Huat who is actually a number theory professor. All of us, including himself, were confused as to why he was assigned to teach this module. This prof, is a blessing. He is the most caring professor I have met and he always displays passion whenever he teaches. His lectures are twice a week from 6pm - 8pm.
                            There is a tendency for students to already be tired at that period but he really puts in the effort to get everyone engaged. He is very patient is taking questions even if they can be repetitive but he makes sure we understand the concepts well.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">As mentioned above, there were 2 lectures on Wednesday and Friday, both at 6pm - 8pm. Tutorial classes were all conducted by him. He refused to hire TAs as he was worried they are not good enough. What a beast.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">There is a weekly graded quiz of 5 questions every week and 3 tests. All were manageable, especially for me with a H2 Further Math / H3 Math background. What I was frustrated about (with my cohort), is that there were a lot of cheating cases which was infuriating. It made me put in more effort than I had planned on this module to be ahead of the bell curve. I appreciate how the professor handled the situation though. After I heard about the cheating cases, it strengthed my resolve to destroy those cheaters in the tests no matter what.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I found this module to be of light workload and easy. I did the tutorials, quizzes and exams pretty fast and I also did quite well. I think people tend to struggle with tests of convergence for series and sequences, and double/triple integrals. Having learnt them before, it was a breeze for me.</p>
