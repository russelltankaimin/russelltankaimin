                    Tan Kai Min, Russell is an aspiring researcher in both the fields of Mathematics and Computer Science. He
                    is currently pursuing a Double Major in Computer Science and Mathematics at the National University of Singapore as
                    a second-year student.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Russell discovered his passion for Mathematics and problem solving at an early age, with Mathematics being his
                    best subject in school. This has led to him participating in various competitions like the local Mathematical
                    Olympiads and other overseas Mathematics Contest. Around the age of 14, he started to dabble around with computers,
                    having obtained his first personal computer and started to pick up C++. As a secondary school kid, he only saw computers
                    as an extra super-power to push Mathematical understanding forward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Having attended Victoria Junior College, he was the 2nd batch of Further Mathematics student after the subject was
                    re-introduced in 2016 after a 10-year hiatus. There, he relished the challenges brought about by Mathematics. He also
                    delved into areas of Computer Science which had very close relations to Mathematics, like Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence
                    and algorithms and data structures and thus picking up more programming languages like Python and Java. He also managed to intern at
                    a local Defence Statutory Board working on building an Elliptic Curve Cryptography module.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After Junior College, he served his National Service as an F-16 technician and served as Controller of Electrical and Instrument
                    Flight. He used his problem-solving skills to help streamline jobs and repetitive processes which improve the efficient coordination
                    of the engineers in the unit. He was also Web Manager of the Base's Innovation Website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently in University, Russell is looking towards fulfilling 2 focus areas in Algorithms and Theory, and Artificial
                    Intelligence. He is also aiming towards completing Mathematics Modules which help him to learn more about algorithms. He does not believe
                    in doing certain modules because of the grades, but rather of interest to him. He advocates emphasis on learning as opposed to chasing marks for grades
                    and also on constantly keeping an open mind for self-improvement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During his spare time, he likes to read books on Mathematics, Cryptography and Algorithms, plays badminton, go for extremely long hikes
                    or otherwise spends loads of time in front of his computer to practice Competitive Programming or reading up on NP-Complete Problems. He looks to further pursue a Masters and 
                    a PhD in the intersection between algorithmic A.I and Cryptography.
