                <p class="description">Short Description : The main paper which I consulted during my internship at DSO before university. This paper introduces the Crystalball framework in SAT solving. Essentially, we view SAT solvers as a composition of classifiers and regressors for different tasks such as branching, clause memory management and restarting. This paper opened my eyes to the combination of artificial intelligence and SAT solving.
                    UNSAT instances will generate a proof of unsatisfiability and this proof contains a bunch of lemmas and deletion clauses. The lemmas consume a large part of memory and some are discarded after a few iterations which resulted in the deletion clauses in the proofs. However, this paper suggested another different approach which collected data of each lemma during the solving process and use
                    the data collected to train a Decision Tree classifier to decide which lemmas to throw away or keep instead of letting it sit in the lemma database. The SAT solver (Cryptominisat) then recompiles to a machine learning model and this speeds up the time taken to determing unsatisfiability. This paper also allows us to see into the black box of SAT solving.

                <p class="description">Short Description : Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) and Conjunctive
                    Normal Form (CNF) are commonly used to encode problems
                    in Boolean algebra. ANFs are typically solved via Grobner Â¨
                    basis algorithms, often using more memory than is feasible;
                    while CNFs are solved using SAT solvers, which cannot exploit
                    the algebra of polynomials naturally. A paradigm
                    that bridges between ANF and CNF solving techniques is proposed: the
                    techniques are applied in an iterative manner to learn facts
                    to augment the original problems. (Adapted from the paper's abstract)</p>
