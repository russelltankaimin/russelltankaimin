        <p>I am currently an undergraduate studying towards a Bachelors of Computer Science and a 2nd Major in Mathematics in the National University of Singapore. My expected graduation year is 2025. I aspire to pursue a research career in the field of <b>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and its applications to the field of defence like cryptography and cryptanalysis.</b></p>
        <p>For research interests, one thing that fascinates me is probabilistic deep learning and how probabilistic models can help in predictions and sometimes better than conventional deterministic machine learning models. I also read widely on papers from major conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML. On the other hand, Alan Turing deviced a Bombe machine that broke Engima which shortened the war by 2 years. The Bombe was intelligent for its time and I do hope machine learning can help systems be "smarter" in breaking ciphers in cryptography.</p>
        <p>I hail from Singapore but with Malaysian roots. I have spent most of my life in Singapore and even completed my National Service as a F-16 Technician in Tengah Airbase (815 Squadron Electrical Instrument Flight)</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in science and technology and I believe they are the tools which has helped mankind progress through the ages. I also take a very keen interest in History and due to my obsession with Horrible Histories, I can name (or sing) you every monarch that ever reigned in Europe. (Try me I dare you ;) )</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I would read alot of books, particularly in science fiction and mystery. I spend a huge portion of my time reading random Wikipedia pages hence I have a huge extensive knowledge of weird things. That would roughly average about 4000 pages annually. I play Xiangqi and Minecraft(the latter to a obsessive extent)</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning new things very much, so pretty much anything can be used to start a conversation with me. </p>
        <p>I am open to internships which focus on machine learning or cryptography, or even better , the intersection of the 2 fields.</p>
