        <p>I am currently an undergraduate studying towards a Bachelors of Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics in the National University of Singapore. My expected graduation year is 2025.</p>
        <p>I hail from Singapore but with Malaysian roots. I have spent most of my life in Singapore and even completed my National Service as a F-16 Technician in Tengah Airbase (815 Squadron Electrical Intstrument Flight)</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in science and technology and I believe they are the tools which has helped mankind progress through the ages. I also take a very keen interest in History and due to my obsession with Horrible Histories, I can name (or sing) you every monarch that ever reigned in Europe. (Try me I dare you ;) )</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I would read alot of books, particularly in science fiction and mystery. I spend a huge portion of my time reading random Wikipedia pages hence I have a huge extensive knowledge of weird things. That would roughly average about 4000 pages annually. I play Xiangqi and Minecraft(the latter to a obsessive extent)</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning new things very much, so pretty much anything can be used to start a conversation with me. </p>
