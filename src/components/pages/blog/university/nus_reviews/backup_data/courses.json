          "contentMain": ">This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing. \n>\n>Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. \n>\n>Topics covered include functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.\n\nThis module was taught in Source which is a sublanguage of Javascript built by the professors themselves. I do not have any experience with Javascript so everything was new to me. I had programming experience prior to university and thus I had no issue in learning the overall syntax. In this module, learning how to think computationally matters more. \n\nThere were missions and optional quests that were done on a game platform the professors built called Source Academy and there were 2 missions and maybe 2 optional quests released weekly which amounted to the huge workload. I personally think this module is a bit overkill in the logistics. Tutorials were fun and I made many friends during the sessions.\n\nAssessment-wise, there was a lot of CAs. These include Reading Assessments(RA) (2 of them), a midterm, a practical exam and a final. I struggled with RA1 as I was really nervous, but I did well for RA2 as I managed to keep my nerves in check. Midterm was atrocious (for me personally, others will disagree) as I panicked and could not think straight. Practical Exam was quite easy for me. I did panic which resulted me in skipping the first 5 parts of the 1st question which was supposed to be easy. Finals was ok, not hard.\n\nOverall, I do not regret not dropping this module for CS2030S because I learnt to appreciate functional programming and communicate thought processes computationally by building mental models. It forms the basis of writing good code in the future. I would highly recommend all students who have to take CS1010 variants as a core requirement to take this instead. I also encouraged others to take this module as an elective as well. A fun module, but with an unnecessarily heavy workload.",

In addition to the standard calculus material, the course also covers simple mathematical modeling techniques and numerical methods in connection with ordinary differential equations. \n>\n>Major topics Preliminaries on sets and number systems. Calculus of functions of one variable and applications. Sequences, series and power series. Functions of several variables. Extrema. First and second order differential equations. Basic numerical methods for ordinary differential equations.\n\nThis module was taught by Prof Chan Heng Huat who is actually a number theory professor. All of us, including himself, were confused as to why he was assigned to teach this module. This prof, is a blessing. He is the most caring professor I have met and he always displays passion whenever he teaches. His lectures are twice a week from 6pm - 8pm.\n                            \nThere is a tendency for students to already be tired at that period but he really puts in the effort to get everyone engaged. He is very patient is taking questions even if they can be repetitive but he makes sure we understand the concepts well.\n\nAs mentioned above, there were 2 lectures on Wednesday and Friday, both at 6pm - 8pm. Tutorial classes were all conducted by him. He refused to hire TAs as he was worried they are not good enough. What a beast.\n\nThere is a weekly graded quiz of 5 questions every week and 3 tests. All were manageable, especially for me with a H2 Further Math / H3 Math background. What I was frustrated about (with my cohort), is that there were a lot of cheating cases which was infuriating. It made me put in more effort than I had planned on this module to be ahead of the bell curve. I appreciate how the professor handled the situation though. After I heard about the cheating cases, it strengthed my resolve to destroy those cheaters in the tests no matter what.\n\nI found this module to be of light workload and easy. I did the tutorials, quizzes and exams pretty fast and I also did quite well. I think people tend to struggle with tests of convergence for series and sequences, and double/triple integrals. Having learnt them before, it was a breeze for me.",

Proofs of results will be presented in the concrete setting. \n>\n>Students are expected to acquire computational facilities and geometric intuition with regard to vectors and matrices. Some applications will be presented. Major topics Systems of linear equations, matrices, determinants, Euclidean spaces, linear combinations and linear span, subspaces, linear independence, bases and dimension, rank of a matrix, inner products, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, linear transformations between Euclidean spaces, applications.\n\nThis module was taught by Prof Victor Tan and Dr Jonathan. Both are competant lecturers but I am at the slot in which Prof Victor teaches. He goes at a slow enough pace for beginners to grasp him. Patience is really key.\n\nWe are expected to watch lecture videos on Tuesdays and attend the lecture conducted via Zoom on Friday. The Zoom lectures are meant to supplement the Tuesday recorded lectures and we have the chance to do some thinking questions with the Prof. Tutorials are really meme. The TA would break us up into breakout rooms and discuss the problems. But problem is no one will talk. It will be radio silence until some hero (usually me) start to speak up. It is very annoying. But whatever, because I already learnt Linear Algebra in H2 F-Math, so I have nothing to lose. Tutorial questions are easy for me. We also had to do Matlab worksheets, which was quite new to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nAssessment-wise, tutorial attendance (not participation lol) was graded, we have 5 HW and a Final exam. The 5 HW was easy for me, but I will cross-check answers with my friends in case got any computation carelessness.\n\nEasy module for H2 Fmath students, I have no issue with the module. Even if it is taught by a trash professor, I think I will do well regardless. Finals was easy for me. Make sure to utilise MATLAB fully to save time on computation. It is open book as well, but I would highly advise against referring to material as it just shows you do not have a good grasp on the concepts. Do the textbook questions. JUST DO THEM!",

Prof Aaron is very passionate and Prof Wong's notes are top-class and rigorous. If you ask me, I prefer Prof Wong teaching this entire module.\n\nThere are 2 lectures, 1 x 2hr and 1 x 1hr and 1 x 2hr tutorial. Tutorial sheets are challenging which I enjoy solving a lot.\n\nThis module is actually my favourite module for my first semester of university. This is because it was new content that I had never learnt before. The ideas were not hard to grasp, but the questions can be very unnecessarily complex. I have a bone to pick though towards the end of the module, specifically Trees and Graphs. These topics are the most important in my opinion, especially when studying Graph Algorithms. However, there was such little time, that it was being rushed through. Hence, there was not enough time to actually internalise, appreciate and grasp the concept. I struggled alot with the last 2 topics. I actually did reasonably well for the Midterms but messed up the Finals as the nerves took over and my mind went blank. I was actually pretty confident of acing the Finals but I guess the pressure got the better of me. I did not do so well hence. Expected an A, but got somewhere near. This failure will forever haunt me.",

          "contentMain": ">More people live in cities now than in any other point in history: how does this change human culture and civilisations? Cities tell a story of our world; they are a testament to humankind’s ability to reshape the environment in lasting ways. They reveal how we interact with the environment and with each other. Cities are created in many forms and for many reasons ranging from defense, religion and economic activity. Through case studies this module examines urban history, lived experiences and how city life has changed over time.\n\nThis module was taught Prof Reyes Portia. She is a very kind and patient Prof. As I was just a freshman navigating my way through University, I constantly emailed her whenever I had doubts. She was quick to reply and encouraging as well. I was once confused by the Chicago Style Citation as there were many variations so I emailed her for clarification. She is a very passionate professor as well and anyone would be lucky to have her teach them. This is my first GE mod under FASS and I do not regret this.\n\nThis module is 100% CA : CA1 is a 250 essay on an image, CA2 is something like an online commentary, CA3 and CA4 are joint final projects\n\nThere is only one lecture every week and we just had to watch videos. Tutorials occur every fortnightly. My TA is Tomoko and she is very helpful. I had a lot of trouble with my essays as I am not really that good in writing but she readily gave me tips on how to improve. Hence, my CA grades improved tremendously. I got a B- for CA1, B+ for CA2 and finally A- for my final project. My tip for this module, hence, is to always seek feedback from your TA directly if you want to improve your CA grades. They are really helpful!\n\nThis module is very chill for me. I have always enjoyed History as a kid and I enjoyed learning about the History of cities. It is very mindblowing when I learned some of the new ideas pertaining to cities. I used to struggle with essays, so when I got my first B- for my CA1, I was really crushed because I thought I had put in a lot of heart and effort but to no favourable results. However, I enjoyed writing CA2 and my final project because I started to learn how to form unique and critical arguments and this led to deeper discussions in my essays. I also tried to put myself in the perspective of the people living in the cities by watching a lot of documentaries and films online. This really made me \"feel\" the module, if you can relate.",

Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. \n>\n>Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.\n\nThis module is taught by Prof Boyd Anderson and Prof Ooi Wei Tsang.\n\nThere are 2 x 2hr lectures and 1 x 1hr Recitation and 1 x 2hr Labs each week\n\nThere are weekly labs, 2 Practical Exams, 1 Midterm and a Final. The labs are meant to make sure you have hands-on experience in applying what you have learnt. The 2 Practical exams are notorious for being challenging, however, I somehow managed to get close to full marks for them. For PA1, I got 29/30 only because I was blind. The compiler threw a warning of raw types, but I cannot find it for some reason. Took me 1hr after the exam ended to finally locate it. I thought I messed up the finals but somehow performed in the upper quartile. Finals was easy for me.\n\nI personally feel very stressed about this module. This is because I am very new to Java as I am used to writing only C++ code. The labs were also very tedious and I would spend quite a while to complete. Marks were deducted for the most trivial mistakes. It is insufficient to just learn from the notes, one needs to code often to really grasp the concepts. Experiment as much as possible and understand why something does or does not work. It is very crucial to find out what you are unsure about and this will help you greatly, as it had helped me. I faced some health issues when doing this module too as I got struck with dengue on the day of PA2. I had to miss lessons but I made enough new friends to actually help me catch up. My TA also managed to accommodate me when I had to rush to the hospital for the blood test by setting up a Zoom Lab lesson. As for module content, this is the first time I came across functional object-oriented programming. Hence, everything was very interesting for me. I was particularly interested in Monads, Functors and also Asynchronous Programming. It prompted me to explore them a little bit deeper after exams and now I am planning to take CS3211 Parallel and Concurrent Programming. Despite all the challenges, I was heartened to get an A for this module.",

Prof Seth tends to speed during the lecture, hence I was unable to understand, let alone internalise what he delivered. However, he is very passionate about algorithms.\n\nThere are 2 x 2hr lectures and 1 x 1hr recitation and 1 x 2hr tutorial.\n\nThere are 8 Problem Sets done on Coursemology with several optional PSets for the opportunity to gain for XPs, followed by a Midterm and a Final. The weightages are not disclosed.\n\nI enjoyed this module very much despite the large workload. We were given a 1hr crash course on Java on our 2nd lecture which I do not really follow. For some reason. I personally learnt a lot for this module. It really deepens the way I think of using algorithms to solve problems. Sometimes, we just have to modify the problem and use the algorithm as a black box, otherwise, we can modify an aspect of the algorithm to solve a problem instance. \n\nRecitations were taught by Jin Zhe, who is very encouraging. I always make the effort to voice out any ideas fearlessly and even managed to solve a question brilliantly. Recitations will introduce more materials which are also examinable. It mainly contains topics that could not be squeezed into the main lecture series, like B-trees, Heaps and Graph Transformation. I struggled a bit by Dynamic Programming as it is the last topic and was taught pretty rushed. I did average for Midterms but very well for the Finals. I think most importantly, we must learn to be flexible and exploit the advantages of several data structures to solve the problem effeciently. This really motivated me to pursue the Algorithms and Theory track. I highly recommend reading CLRS for a better grasp for the topics.\n\n",

I belonged to the lecture group of the latter.\n\nThere are 2 x 2hr lecture slots, but one of the lecture slots was used to watch the lecture recording, the other was simply a zoom lecture to consolidate the content learnt.

However, there were new topics like F-distribution, Joint Probability Distributions etc. However, they were not much of an issue. If you own a graphical calculator, getting the answer is a matter of pushing buttons on it. I was very annoyed by the format of the Finals.

The questions were very subjective and me and my friends actually spent time debating on a lot of issues. Perhaps that was the intended purpose? I did learn something from the module.

I was concurrently taking ST2334 and I felt that a lot of material taught in GEA1000 was repeated and not rigorous which lost my attention and appreciation for the module. Midterms went disastrous for me because of an invigilator who keeps distracting me by turning on her mic over zoom to call people out to turn on their camera every 2 minutes which led me to constantly lose my train of thoughts and redid the question. Hence I was really dissatisfied with my performance over the midterms. For the project, I pretty much carried most of the time because apparently I am the only one who knows what is going on. I even at the last minute, spotted a very glaring error and had to correct them on the spot. I pretty much gave up for the finals but it is not that hard as well.

Done in pairs of two, Orbital students propose, design, execute, implement and market their project to peers and faculty. Peer assessment and critique of others’ projects are key components of the modules’ deliverables.\n\nThis module is my first forray into Software Engineering. My partner and I attempted Orbital at the Artemis level. Everything was new to me and I had to learn a lot of technologies from scratch. Previously, I only had research background and I normally play around with research problems. My partner and I built a mobile application which can help students do module planning more seamlessly by using a SAT Solver. Our TA was very encouraging and was always ready to lend a helping hand by giving us useful advice to point us in the right direction when we lack the necessary technical knowledge.\n\nThe entire frontend was built using XML and Android Java with Materials UI whereas the backend (Solver) was built entirely in Python. One particular problem I encountered was handling database calls. I realised, through monitoring the database calls, that reading and writing into the database was asynchronous. When I tried to write and read into the database in that sequence, I realised that the document was being modified whilst being read, which lead to a lot of incorrect output. I had no experience in Asynchronous Programming, but I learnt how to use the Completable Future Monad to handle such database calls. I even took up Parallel Programming courses so that I could better understand how multi-threading works and how to go about properly parallelising tasks.\n\nMy partner and I also had issues with the UI design of our Android App. The entire aesthetic look of the App was built using XML and Material UI. Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve the look that many other teams achieved (by using higher level API and other frameworks). Nonetheless, despite us building our app using Android Java, and also a lack of artistic flair on our part, we redid the entire look of our app. We also received praise by our mentor and 3 other teams during our project evaluation that our UI greatly improved by miles.\n\nAnother issue was setting up the backend for our app. We were using Heroku free tier to run our backend scripts as well, but due to the large number of build packs used, deploying was impossible as the server would time out after 15 minutes. Due to our inexperience, we tried to download and precompile 23GB of slug and then push them into the backend instead to save time. However, our computers were not configured to the environment required for the slug to compile and so we spent 3 days trying to figure out a workaround. However, it was easily resolved with an email to Heroku’s Helpdesk to extend the build time to 30 minutes instead after realising pre-compilation was an impossible task.\n\nLastly, compatibility issues were also a very huge problem from the start. We originally planned to use Google ORTools as one of the API to implement a feature of the app. However, it was not well documented that ORTools API was not compatible with computers of ARM Architecture. I tasked myself to actually try out the API but realised that the native libraries could not be loaded. I then spent 1 full week trying to debug the API but to no avail. We only found out after searching through Stack Overflow that the maintainer mentioned that it was not tested on M1 Macs yet. We had to abandon the API and used Z3 SMT Solver instead which was developed by Microsoft. This would make the implementation more complex as well, but regardless, we managed to build the feature successfully and adhere to Software Engineering Principles despite the added complexity.\n\nDespite all these challenges, my partner and I managed to achieve the highest level of achievement possible for the module and even presented our posters during the project showcase. The achievement came with many setbacks along the way, but it definitely taught me to be resilient and to persevere no matter what. I think these traits are really important in the current workforce. We also learnt how to write industry-style code and several software engineering principles which would be very valuable to apply in any technology-based setting in the future. Thus, this challenging task actually turned out to be very fruitful and rewarding.",
