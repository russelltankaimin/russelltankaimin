        "So, it is what it is. One more year in university. I did not hesitate this time. When the email came to invite students to apply for the Double Degree Programme, I hesitated in Year 1. Not this time. I realised I have a lot of interests in Mathematics and I enjoyed applying them. A double major would simply not be enough. It is a good opportunity and hence I took it at the end of Year 2.", 
        "According to the website, 'This double degree programme, which is a “specially-designed or structured DDP” for students reading major in Mathematics or Applied Mathematics*, is jointly offered by the School of Computing and the Department of Mathematics. It provides a standardized structure for students who are keen to pursue both disciplines and offers two specializations (optional) for students with special interest in either Algorithms and Computation or Multimedia Modeling.'",
        "I am actually excited yet very nervous. There is always the worry if I could graduate in time. I was already doing UROPS and now I have to do CHS modules. I think Year 3 will be a test of my mettle and tenacity to pull through the seemingly high workload.",
      "I will still be doing 2 specialisations: Algorithms and Theory, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. For Mathematics, I am hoping to do more algorithmic modules like Linear and Non-Linear Programming and perhaps some training in Algebra (Group Theory) as well.", "Wish me luck!"]
