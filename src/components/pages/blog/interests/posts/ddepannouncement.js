When the email came to invite students to apply for the Double Degree Programme, I hesitated in Year 1. Not this time. I realised I have a lot of interests in Mathematics and I enjoyed applying them. A double major would simply not be enough. It is a good opportunity and hence I took it at the end of Year 2."

          "content": "This double degree programme, which is a “specially-designed or structured DDP” for students reading major in Mathematics or Applied Mathematics, is jointly offered by the School of Computing and the Department of Mathematics. It provides a standardized structure for students who are keen to pursue both disciplines and offers two specializations (optional) for students with special interest in either Algorithms and Computation or Multimedia Modeling."

          "content": "I am actually excited yet very nervous. There is always the worry if I could graduate in time. I was already doing UROPS and now I have to do CHS modules. I think Year 3 will be a test of my mettle and tenacity to pull through the seemingly high workload. I will still be doing 2 specialisations: Algorithms and Theory, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. For Mathematics, I am hoping to do more algorithmic modules like Linear and Non-Linear Programming and perhaps some training in Algebra (Group Theory) as well."
